# SlingShot for Gnome Shell

This is an extension for Gnome Shell that allows to use Slingshot Launcher
(from Elementary OS) with Gnome Shell. It replaces the ACTIVITIES button with
an APPLICATIONS button that, when clicked on, launches Slingshot Launcher.

## How to install

Just type

        ./install

and it will install the extension in your account. You also need to have
installed Slingshot Launcher. Under Ubuntu is as easy as type

        sudo add-apt-repository ppa:elementary-os/daily
        sudo apt-get update
        sudo apt-get install slingshot-launcher gala

Maybe you will want to also install 'plank', 'elementary-icon-theme' and
'elementary-theme' packages to have a full Pantheon experience under Gnome
Shell. To ensure that your system uses the elementary themes, just install
also the 'gnome-tweak-tool' package and use it to set the icons, gtk theme and
window theme to the elementary ones.
